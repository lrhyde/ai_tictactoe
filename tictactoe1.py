"""
Accept one command line argument â€“ a 9-character Tic Tac Toe board.
If the board is empty, ask the user (using an input statement) whether the computer should go first or the user should go first. X always plays first, but either the computer or the user might be player X.
If the board is not empty, assume that the computer plays next and figure out which token the computer should be. (Since X plays first, if there are an equal number of Xs and Os, X should play next. Otherwise, O.)
At each computer turn, your script should print out all possible moves and classify them as L (losing), T (tying), or W (winning), under the assumption of perfect play from both sides going forward.
At each player turn, just display the board and ask the player to type in a number from 0 to 8 to move.
Play perfectly.
